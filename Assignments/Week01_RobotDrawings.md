ROBOT DRAWINGS
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 7

Today we have amazingly deep programs for making art using computers, like Photoshop and Maya. But the concepts behind these tools is the same as it was in the earliest days of computer graphics: basic shapes, a coordinate system, pixels and colors on a screen. This week, we'll explore these as our toolset and get more familiar thinking about images as numbers and positions.

Building on the code examples you learned today, your assignment is to **generate one drawing of a robot using only code.** Use any combination of shapes, color, stroke, transparency, etc to make your robots as detailed as possible. **Your sketch should be 800 x 800 pixels, and exported as a PNG file.**

Create a sketch called `LastnameFirstname_ROBOT` – the basic structure will be:

    void setup() {
    	size(800,800);

    	// code to draw your robot here!

    	// save your robot, but be sure to change the filename
    	save("LastnameFirstname_ROBOT.png");
    }

*If you already have some coding experience, please try to just use the methods we learned today – adding fancy code and leveraging what you know will be encouraged later, but for now I'd like you to get used to the coordinate system and Processing's drawing functions. Think about how to leverage these simple tools (gradients drawn with lots of shapes of varying color, for example). Making functions to clean up your code is ok, but no for loops or animation please!*

### STRETCH GOALS  
No problem drawing your robot? Try these challenges:

* Make your image resizable using `width` and `height` instead of set positions.  
* Try adding shading to your robot, and/or drawing in perspective!

### TURNING IN  
To turn in your project, zip your sketch's folder (with the code and png file in it). To zip a folder:

* Right-click the sketch folder...  
* On Mac, click `Compress...` to zip  
* On PC, click `Send To > Compressed...`

If necessary, rename to `LastnameFirstname_ROBOT.zip` and upload to Canvas before the start of class. In class next week, we'll run the code and look at everyone's robots together.

### PROJECTS/ARTISTS SHOWN  
* The collages of [Henri Matisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse), who uses simple shapes to create beautiful and dynamic drawings  
* Before the computer mouse and interactive drawing software: programming by [punchcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era)  
* Ivan Sutherland's [*Sketchpad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) system ([video](https://youtu.be/USyoT_Ha_bA?t=3m30s)) and the [light pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen)  
* *The Incredible Machine: Applications, Computer Graphics, Look at Future Uses* from Bell Laboratories in the 1960s, including lots of examples of input and output ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r18i-uR6BD4))  
* John Whitney's animation [*Catalog*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbV7loKp69s), created in 1966 as a record of the many visual effects he was able to create with the computer  
* [Lillian Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Schwartz), working at Bell Labs, created many early computer animations including [*ENIGMA*](http://lillian.com/1972-enigma-4-min-20-sec/) from 1972  
* Before printers, artists like John Whitney would output their work to CRT screens and photograph them (for animations, frame-by-frame) using devices like above  
* Single-line drawings by Waclaw Szpakowski in the 1920s  
* The amazing (and relevant to this week) *The Art of Computer Designing: A Black and White Approach* by Osamu Sato from 1993  

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project (and most upcoming ones) will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
