CLOCKS
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28

This week, we've seen some basic ways of turning a static sketch into an animated one, and in the coming weeks we'll build on this even more, going from animated to interactive. [John Maeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda) – an artist, designer, educator, and creator of [Design By Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_By_Numbers) (which led to Processing) – made a series of experimental clocks (seen above) as a way of thinking about designing with code. Your assignment, inspired by Maeda's work and the other examples we looked at, is to create your own visual, non-traditional clocks using code.

Think about ways of showing time that are interesting visually, conceptually, or poetically. Your clocks don't need to be easy to read, or even useful! Should they measure traditional units of time, or something personal, biological, political, or unusual? Consider timescale and [alternative divisions of time](https://youtu.be/At5atF4mKiU), and how you can use the built-in `hour()`, `minute()`, `second()`, and `millis()` to drive visuals onscreen. Try to push past the obvious first ideas and into something suprising.

We'll also have our first quiz next week – if you missed our study session in class, see [the notes](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/blob/master/Quizzes/Quiz1.pdf).

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* Can you add boolean "flags" to your code, allowing multiple modes for your clock to take?  
* Can you record an animated gif of your piece? Use [this library](https://github.com/01010101/GifAnimation) and the sample code in this week's `code` folder  

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
* Your project should show time in an interesting, visual way that isn't just a traditional clock  
* Name your sketch `LastnameFirstname_CLOCK`  
* Your sketch can be any size, but think about how that changes our experience of your clock  
* When done, create an image of your clock running, either using the `save()` command or a cropped screenshot  
* Zip your sketch, with the image insize, and upload it to Canvas before the start of class

* NIST's [time and frequency division](https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division), and [time.gov](http://www.time.gov/) which accounts for network delay (and is a terrible website)  
* Not into hours and minutes? What about [decimal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time)?  

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
